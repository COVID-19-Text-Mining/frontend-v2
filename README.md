# COVIDScholar.org
This is the __frontend__ of [COVIDScholar](https://www.covidscholar.org).

### Aknowledgements ###
This web application uses some open-source UI code from [Vespa CORD-19 Search](https://cord19.vespa.ai/) and our backend is partly powered by [Vespa](https://vespa.ai). However, our data and algorithms are not the same as those being served at [cord19.vespa.ai](https://cord19.vespa.ai/). 

With that said, this iteration of our site couldn't have been possible without the open-source code made accessible by the [Vespa](https://vespa.ai).
